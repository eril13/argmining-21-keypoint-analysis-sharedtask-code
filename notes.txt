### Data: 
- ArgKP dataset contains 24k pairs of (key-point, argument), on 28 topics, part of ArgQ-Rank-30k dataset that contains 30k arguments on 71 topics.

### Track-1 - Key-point Matching:
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05369.pdf

- **Task**: Given a set of key-points and arguments, compute for each key-points the matching arguments.

- **Baselines**:
	- ALBERT (some version of BERT) with F1-score 0.809 and a selection policy BM+TH (Best match and threshold)
- **Errors**:
	+ Sharing some key-phrases but the meaning is different	
	+ Sharing large portion of the sentence but not the main point
	+ They are at least partially related, but labeled as non matching due to a better fitting key point for the same argument.
	+ Implicit relation that requires general knowledge to uncover.

- **Ideas**:
	+ Siamese NN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf)
	+ LTR with BERT
	+ Incorporating general knowledge

### Track-2 - key-point Analysis:
- https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.371.pdf
- **Task**: Given a collection of arguments, generate a set of salient key-points that represent the collection and the matching arguments.

- **Baseline idea**: 
	1. Extract a set of candidate key-points: short sentences, don't start with pronouns, and highest quality score.
	2. Score their salience based on how much arguments they match (Track-1)
	3. Select the most salient ones to be the key-points.
- **Ideas**:
	+ Represent key-points as a graph problem, with page-rank
	+ ...
